# Changelog

## 2026-03-14

### Runtime fixes

- Fixed function-component reconciliation so components that return `nil` correctly delete previously rendered children.
- Fixed DOM-less subtree deletion so all descendant sibling DOM branches are removed during unmount.
- Fixed stale hook ownership on reused/skipped function components so later stateful updates target the correct fiber.
- Fixed `GoUseState` so nil-able state types can be reset with `set(nil)`.
- Fixed `GoUseAtom` so nil-able atom state types can be reset with `set(nil)`.
- Fixed `GoUseAtom` initialization on fresh component fibers so global atom hooks work on first use.
- Fixed scheduler update propagation so clean ancestors are marked even when a leaf is already dirty.
- Fixed global runtime initialization so `InitGlobalRuntime()` can upgrade a lazily created global runtime.
- Fixed HTML component helper wrappers so component refs are wrapped as component elements instead of being passed as raw children.
- Removed the artificial `50ms` delay from the wasm fetch hook.
- Removed runtime debug logging from the wasm fetch hook.
- Completed the runtime event wrapper so `GoEvent` exposes target and key-code access and safely handles missing event methods.
- Optimized `Text()` shim output to use the text-element layout directly.
- Normalized the native fetch stub error and removed per-call closure allocation from the stub implementation.

### Runtime optimization work

- Added work-in-progress fiber reuse through alternates in the reconciler and scheduler.
- Added batched atom unsubscription with `UnsubscribeMany(...)` to reduce lock churn during cleanup.
- Optimized component helper child creation in `html.go` to avoid unnecessary wrapper overhead.
- Specialized `WASMDOMAdapter.WrapFunction` so callback dispatch type selection happens once at wrap time instead of on every invocation.
- Kept only measured low-risk optimizations and reverted regressions found during benchmark runs.

### Runtime tests

- Added contract-focused reconciler tests.
- Added extra hooks contract and edge-case tests.
- Added scheduler contract and edge-case tests.
- Added atom state contract and cleanup tests.
- Added runtime global-init and render contract tests.
- Added HTML helper contract tests.
- Added wasm fetch hook tests.
- Added wasm event adapter tests.
- Added shim tests for global wrapper behavior.
- Added interfaces contract tests and compile-time adapter assertions.
- Added exhaustive native runtime coverage tests and raised native `internal/runtime` statement coverage to `100%`.

### Browser component and integration tests

- Added Playwright component tests for local state isolation, rerender stability, effect cleanup, and `UseId` behavior.
- Added Playwright integration tests for todo flows, shared atom propagation, theme updates, fetch flows, and form handling.
- Added deep state stress tests covering `5+`, `25+`, `100+`, repeated burst updates, mixed local/shared state, and rerender persistence.
- Added test app components to exercise stress and mixed-state scenarios.
- Added mock API and test server endpoints needed by the browser suites.

### Benchmarks

- Added runtime microbenchmarks for reconciler hot paths.
- Added hooks microbenchmarks.
- Added scheduler microbenchmarks.
- Added atom state microbenchmarks.
- Added runtime wiring microbenchmarks.
- Added HTML helper microbenchmarks.
- Added shim microbenchmarks.
- Added native fetch stub microbenchmarks.
- Added `types.go` microbenchmarks.
- Added wasm adapter boundary benchmarks for DOM operations and callback wrapping.

### Tooling and developer workflow

- Rebuilt the development server around Node/Express and saved it in `tools/dev-server/`.
- Added dynamic `/examples` listing based on the filesystem instead of hard-coded routes.
- Updated server scripts and tooling docs to use the new development server.
- Added a wasm test execution helper in `tools/go_js_wasm_exec.bat`.
- Added new test scripts for component, integration, and state browser test layers.

### Validation status

- `go test ./internal/runtime` passes.
- Native `internal/runtime` statement coverage is `100%`.
- Browser component, integration, and deep state stress suites pass.
- Wasm runtime and adapter tests pass in the separate `js/wasm` test lane.
