# Feature Backlog

Gap analysis against React/Next/Solid ecosystems (2026-06-11). Ordered by
impact; exactly three active items carry the next-work marker.

## High impact

- [ ] [next] **Selective / progressive hydration (islands)** - hydration is
  whole-tree with per-subtree mismatch fallback. Add a first-class API for
  hydrate-on-visible / hydrate-on-interaction islands, plus budget-driven
  validation around the static-islands example seed. Attacks the measured
  wasm-startup gap vs React directly.
- [x] **Streaming SSR** - `ui.RenderToStream` / `RenderToStreamObserved` now
  write a shell chunk before unresolved `AsyncBoundary` content, wrap fallback
  placeholders in stable boundary comments, flush out-of-order replacement
  chunks as suspensions resolve, respect cancellation, report SSR metrics, and
  pin the public API surface with runtime/UI/API compatibility tests.
- [x] **Real suspension for async data** - `AsyncBoundary` now supports
  render-time `ui.SuspendUntil` / `ui.Await` suspension, runtime fallback
  capture, retry when the async signal resolves, SSR fallback rendering, API
  baseline coverage, and focused native/wasm tests.
- [x] **TinyGo build profile** - `gwc build` / `gwc release` now accept a
  guarded `tinygo` profile that runs `tinygo build -target=wasm -opt=z -tags
  production`, records toolchain/target metadata in JSON summaries and release
  manifests, fails early with an install hint when TinyGo is unavailable, and
  documents the constrained leaf-app compatibility boundary.
- [ ] [next] **Route-level code splitting** - Go wasm ships as one binary.
  Multi-binary loading exists in examples (multi-client-binary, benchmark
  worker) but there is no lazy-chunk API for loading route logic on demand.

## Medium impact

- [x] **Hooks-rules analyzer** - `gwc lint` now includes a parser-backed
  `gwc-hooks` pass for `ui`/`state`/`fetch`/`flags`/`router` `Use*` calls
  inside conditionals, loops, or nested functions, with `-skip-hook-rules`
  for explicit opt-out.
- [x] **`UseWebSocket` / `UseEventSource` hooks** - `fetch` now provides
  browser realtime hooks with bounded message/error buffers, capped reconnect
  backoff, heartbeat state, native unsupported stubs, and wasm transport
  tests.
- [x] **Query-cache ergonomics** - `fetch` now provides tag-aware `UseQuery`
  and `LoadQuery`, `InvalidateQueryTag(s)` / `DisposeQueryTag`, paginated
  `UseInfiniteQuery`, and rollback-capable optimistic cache updates on top of
  the existing shared cache.
- [ ] **Browser devtools extension** - devtools exist as in-page panels only.
  Ship a Chrome/Firefox extension (component tree, props/state inspection,
  atom graph, commit profiling). The plugin kernel was shaped for this.
- [x] **Go-source debugging workflow** - `gwc build` / `gwc release` now accept
  a first-class `debug` / `source-debug` profile that records `gcflags`,
  builds Go `js/wasm` artifacts with untrimmed paths and `-gcflags=all=-N -l`,
  exposes `gcflags` through `pwa.WasmReleaseFlags`, documents the browser
  stack-correlation workflow, and clearly states the current Go-toolchain
  boundary around source maps and DWARF sections.

## Lower impact / ecosystem

- [ ] **Headless a11y component kit** - package the overlay/focus primitives
  into a menu/combobox/listbox/datepicker/table set instead of examples.
- [ ] **Animation primitives** - transition hooks exist; add spring physics,
  FLIP, and a gesture layer.
- [ ] **Scheduler ergonomics and instrumentation** - keep this as the
  documentation/devtools follow-up for the enterprise priority-lane and
  backpressure work below, rather than tracking a second scheduler
  implementation item.
- [ ] **Server-component-style model** - everything ships to the client; a
  server-only component concept would shrink the wasm binary.
- [ ] **RUM / OpenTelemetry export** - logs carry trace/span IDs but there is
  no OTLP browser exporter.
- [x] **Feature flags / experimentation hooks** - `flags` now provides
  browser-visible feature flags, deterministic weighted experiments, shared
  registry hooks, README coverage, and unit tests.

## Enterprise tier - runtime architecture

- [ ] **Multi-instance runtimes** - `globalRuntime` is a singleton: two GWC
  apps (or two GWC versions via micro-frontends) on one page share one
  runtime, atom registry, and scheduler, so a crash reset or hot reload in
  one app touches the other. Make `Runtime` instantiable per root with
  isolated atom registries.
- [ ] **Priority-lane scheduling with backpressure** - one work queue today:
  background data floods compete equally with keystroke re-renders, nothing
  coalesces update storms (N atom writes -> N dispatches), and a started
  render cannot be interrupted. The React-lanes / Solid-scheduler gap.
- [ ] **Bounded internal state** - `uiQueue`, pending-effect lists, and
  loader/diagnostic registries grow with usage; adopt a framework-wide
  policy of bounded ring buffers with eviction, plus instrumentation of
  fiber-tree size and listener counts over time.

## Enterprise tier - contracts & guarantees

- [x] **Public API stability contract** - `tools/api_compat_guard` now pins
  exported `fetch`/`flags`/`router`/`state`/`ui` symbols for native and wasm
  targets, allowing additive changes while failing removals unless the
  baseline is intentionally updated.
- [x] **Specified failure-mode matrix** - crash containment now documents the
  render, event, effect, cleanup, async, and fatal-phase trust boundaries in
  the observability manual, with runtime tests pinning boundary recovery,
  async containment, and fatal-phase policy.
- [x] **Versioned wire protocols** - hydration bootstrap sidecars already
  carry schema versions; hot-reload WebSocket messages, app-bridge snapshots,
  and persisted state snapshots now write v1 protocol metadata, accept legacy
  missing-version payloads, and reject future mismatches with diagnostics.
- [x] **Versioned state-snapshot migration** - hot-reload snapshots now carry
  an app-owned `snapshotVersion`; `hotreload.Config` can register ordered
  migrations for shared atom state plus component path and identity aliases,
  and missing migrations fail with diagnostics instead of silently restoring
  the wrong shape.

## Enterprise tier - enforcement & correctness

- [x] **Threading-model enforcement** - hooks are render-thread-only by
  convention; dev/test builds now track the goroutine that owns the active
  render fiber, emit `GWC-RUNTIME-HOOK-THREADING`, and panic before a
  cross-goroutine hook call can mutate hook state. The built-in
  `gwc-hooks` lint pass now reports direct hook calls inside goroutine
  launches in addition to conditionals, loops, and nested functions.
- [ ] [next] **Strict mode** - strict hydration exists, but no general dev-time
  strict mode: double-invoke renders to flush impure components, warn on
  setState-during-render, detect asymmetric effect cleanups.
- [ ] **Deterministic replay** - capture/replay of an update stream for
  reproducing production bugs; profiling already records events
  internally, but nothing exports or replays them.
- [x] **Migration tooling** - `gwc migrate` now runs lifecycle upgrade, writes
  `bin/gwc-migrate-report.json` with compatibility findings, and supports
  `-apply` parser-backed rewrites from deprecated router selector calls
  (`GoRegisterRoute` / `GoGetRoute`) to `Register` / `Current` while leaving
  comments and string literals untouched.

## Enterprise tier - resilience

- [ ] **Fetch circuit breakers / retry policy** - the cache and mutation
  queue exist, but there's no declarative retry/backoff/circuit-breaker
  policy for flaky enterprise networks.
- [ ] **Long-session memory hygiene** - no GC-pressure monitoring or leak
  diagnostics for week-long dashboard sessions, which is where wasm apps
  fail quietly.

## Capability reviews (2026-06-11) - build items + what to test

### PWA / offline mode

- [ ] **Generated service worker + manifest for the docs site** - sitegen
  generates `sw.js` from `pwa.BuildCacheStoragePlan` output and
  `manifest.json` from a `pwa.Manifest` value (same generated-artifact
  pattern as the boot shell; nothing authored); the app registers via
  `pwa.RegisterServiceWorker` at boot.
  Test for: registration lifecycle reaches `activated` in a real browser;
  precache list exactly matches the release-manifest SHA set (no silent
  drops); a full offline reload serves shell + site.wasm + catalog from
  CacheStorage (playwright `context.SetOffline(true)`); deploying a new
  build hash evicts stale caches and serves the new wasm (no
  half-old/half-new mix); SW update flow does not strand an open tab.
- [ ] **Offline mutation replay hardening** - `fetch.MutationQueue` exists;
  prove it under adversarial conditions.
  Test for: mutations enqueued offline replay exactly once after
  reconnect (no dupes on rapid online/offline flaps); replay order
  preserved; executor failure leaves the entry queued, not dropped;
  queue survives a page reload mid-outage (IndexedDB persistence);
  `pwa.InspectDiagnostics` queue counts match reality.
- [ ] **Installability flow e2e** - `pwa.ObserveInstallability` exists but
  has no browser test.
  Test for: beforeinstallprompt capture, prompt() round trip, and state
  cleanup on dismissal (chromium supports faking the event).

### Session / long-term web storage

- [ ] **`UsePersistedState[T](key, initial, area)` hook** - bind a UseState
  to localStorage/sessionStorage/IndexedDB with write-through and
  cross-tab change subscription.
  Test for: state survives unmount/remount and full reload; storage
  `storage`-event from a second tab updates the first tab's component
  (two playwright pages, one context); JSON round-trip of non-trivial T
  (structs, slices); corrupted stored value falls back to initial
  instead of panicking (crash containment must catch decode panics);
  quota-exceeded write surfaces an error state, does not wedge renders.
- [ ] **`RequestPersistentStorage` helper** - wrap
  `navigator.storage.persist()`; diagnostics already read the flag.
  Test for: persisted flag flips after grant (headless chromium grants
  silently); denial path returns false without error; native build
  returns the unavailable stub.
- [ ] **Snapshot schema versioning** (promotes the enterprise contracts
  item) - add a version field + migration hook to
  `state.SaveSnapshot`/`SavePersistentSnapshot` payloads.
  Test for: v(N) snapshot restores through a registered v(N-1)->v(N)
  migration; unknown future version is rejected loudly, not silently
  dropped; missing-version legacy payloads still restore (compat path);
  partial migration failure restores nothing (atomicity).
- [ ] **Typed cookie helper** - first-class document.cookie access for
  session-adjacent apps (read/write/expire, SameSite/Secure attrs).
  Test for: attribute round-trips, expiry honored, and unavailability
  on native builds.

### Cross-component eventing

- [ ] **`events.UseTopic[T](topic)` fan-out bus** - typed in-app pub/sub
  with delivery to every subscriber, subscriptions tied to component
  lifecycle (atoms have fan-out but state semantics; channels have event
  semantics but single-receiver delivery).
  Test for: N subscribers each receive each published event exactly once
  (no coalescing of rapid bursts); publish order preserved per
  subscriber; unmounted components stop receiving and leak no
  subscriptions (registry size returns to baseline - pairs with the
  bounded-internal-state item); late subscriber receives nothing by
  default (no replay) with replay-last-value opt-in tested separately;
  publishing from a goroutine is safe (threading-model rules) or routed
  through a guarded dispatch; a panicking subscriber is contained and
  does not stop delivery to the remaining subscribers.
- [ ] **Cross-root eventing guidance + test** - components in different GWC
  roots / exported custom elements communicating via
  `interop.GetDocumentEvents()` CustomEvents.
  Test for: typed detail payload round-trip through Dispatch/Subscribe;
  subscription cleanup releases the underlying js.Func (no released-
  function warnings); events cross from a GWC tree into a plugin-host
  panel and back.
- [ ] **Cross-tab eventing soak** - `SubscribeDecodedCrossTab[T]` works in
  the example; pin it with a test.
  Test for: typed envelope round-trip between two pages in one browser
  context; decode error of a malformed envelope surfaces via the error
  callback, not a contained panic; channel close mid-flight does not
  crash either tab.

### Accessibility (visually impaired)

- [ ] **Automated a11y audit in the browser suites** - the primitives
  (UseAnnouncer, UseFocusTrap, UseCompositeNavigation, AccessibleOverlay)
  exist but no axe-core-style audit runs in CI, so contrast/label/name
  regressions ship silently.
  Test for: every public example page passes an automated audit at the
  serious/critical level; the audit runs inside the existing playwright
  lanes; intentional violations in a fixture page are detected (the
  audit itself is tested, not just wired); docs-site routes included.
- [ ] **Docs-site dogfood: a11y primitives in the search modal** - the new
  pure-GWC site's search modal lacks UseFocusTrap/UseAnnouncer and the
  gallery filters lack composite keyboard navigation.
  Test for: focus is trapped while the modal is open and restored to the
  Search button on close (mirror TestAccessibleOverlayBrowserE2E);
  result-count changes are announced politely; Escape closes from any
  focused element inside the modal; filter chips are arrow-key navigable.
- [ ] **Reduced-motion / contrast preference hooks** - interop exposes
  GetMediaQuery but there is no UsePrefersReducedMotion /
  UsePrefersColorScheme hook pair, so apps re-derive them.
  Test for: hook reflects the media query at mount, updates live when the
  emulated preference flips (playwright EmulateMedia), and unsubscribes
  on unmount without leaking js.Func handles.

### Internationalization

- [ ] **Message extraction + locale completeness tooling** - nothing scans
  code for T(namespace, key) usage to scaffold catalogs or diff locales;
  incomplete translations ship silently (pairs with the enterprise
  missing-translation enforcement item).
  Test for: extraction finds every T() call across build tags (wasm and
  native files); diff reports keys missing per locale and stale keys no
  longer referenced; a gwc lane fails CI when a non-default locale is
  incomplete; dynamic/computed keys are reported as unverifiable rather
  than silently skipped.
- [ ] **Relative-time and list formatting** - FormatNumber/FormatDate exist
  but there is no FormatRelativeTime ("3 days ago") or FormatList
  ("a, b, and c"), the two most-requested formatters after dates.
  Test for: CLDR-correct output across at least en/fr/ar/ja including an
  RTL locale; plural-category interaction (1 day vs 2 days vs 0 days);
  boundary rounding (59s vs 1m, 23h vs 1d); native and wasm parity.
- [ ] **Browser Intl bridge** - the i18n formatters are framework
  implementations; expose an opt-in interop path to the browser's full
  ICU (Intl.NumberFormat/DateTimeFormat) for locales/options the Go
  implementation does not cover.
  Test for: bridge output matches browser Intl for sampled locale/option
  matrices; graceful fallback to the Go formatter when Intl or the
  requested locale is unavailable; no js.Func leaks across repeated
  formats (formatter instances cached and released).

## Maintenance backlog (carried from the test/perf campaign)

- [ ] Lazy DOM binding - the remaining named lever for the React DOM-ready
  startup gap (syscall/js bridge-bound).
- [ ] Churn benchmark bistability - investigate the bimodal results in the
  render-benchmark churn scenario.
- [ ] Multi-hot-reload state-survival e2e - cover state restoration across
  several consecutive hot reloads in a browser test.
- [ ] Multi-entrypoint deadcode union - `gwc` deadcode analysis should union
  reachability across all entrypoints instead of per-app.
- [ ] Compact-attrs element constructor - element creation fast path for the
  common small-attribute case.
- [x] Bump GitHub Actions to Node 24-ready versions before the June 16, 2026
  forced upgrade.
  Updated workflow references on 2026-06-11 to current Node 24-ready major
  lines for `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-go`, `actions/configure-pages`,
  `actions/upload-pages-artifact`, `actions/deploy-pages`,
  `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/attest-build-provenance`, and
  `softprops/action-gh-release`.
